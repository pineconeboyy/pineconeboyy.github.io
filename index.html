                hi!! this is just a little website for me to practice my html and css and whatever else!
                i thought it'd be fun to add a little personal touch like everyone else here,
                so i'll be sharing my art and oc stuff here too :)  
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li> <b>11|27|24</b> - tried to make the phone layout look better!!!! also fixed the buttons on
                the side so the entire thing is clickable </li>
                <li> <b>7|4|24</b> - adjusted every page to look better on phone screens!! it's not perfect but its
                definitely better than what it was before. i'll fix it for tablet screens eventually but that's not
                a priority since i feel like desktops and phones are most used when looking at this site </li>
                <li> <b>7|3|24</b> - figured out a way to format my oc stuff and started putting some in!!
                i have way more than this but for now i'm satisfied with it :> ignore the clone high jfk picture in 
                every single character sheet, i'll get around to drawing actual pictures for those eventually </li>
                <li> <b>7|2|24</b> - finished the interests tab, added my art into the art tab, and adjusted some info in
                the 'about me' section since i've changed during the really long break i took from working on this :) </li>
                <li> <b>7|13|23</b> - put my socials in the 'about me' page and started on the interests page! 'anime'
                is the only section done so far </li>
                <li> <b>7|10|23</b> - added the about me page in :] i think it looks rly nice!!! </li>
                <li> <b>7|9|23</b> - got the general theme figured out! also got in a funky scrollbar too <3 </li>
                <li> <b>7|8|23</b> - started coding this website! very barebones </li>

                <li> > figure out how to get music to play in the bg </li>
                <li> > also figure out how to get the little chat box thing. those are fun </li>
                <li> > figure out how to make this page responsive while still looking nice bc it looks. 
                    terrible rn on mobile devices </li>
                <li> > maybe add a tab for commission info? we'll see we'll see </li>
